I use this website to provide some information about me, my studies and future research interests, as well as to display a few projects I did in the past. Fell free to browse a little.

            <hr>
        </h2>
        <div class="text-block">
            After I finished school and my civil service in 2016 I enrolled at the <a class="text-link" href="https://www.tugraz.at/home"> Technical University Graz</a> in order to study physics. My first day I began equipped with the book "A brief history of time" and the naive goal to unify quantum theory and gravity. What a fool I was! A bit overwelmed with all the interesting topics, I started to study mechanics, thermodynamics,  electromagnetism, fluidmechanics, special relatitivity, solid state physics and quantum mechanics both theoreticaly and experimentally. Unfortunatly general relativity was not a part of the bachelors programm. However I had great fun studying and teaching undergraduate physics. My first position as a student assistent was on the subject of linear algebra in my third semester. Unexpectedly I discovered my fascination with abstract maths when I was preparing for that position. Thus, during my physics bachelor, I picked up several classes in the maths bachelor too. 
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            At the end of my physics bachelor 2019, I began to work partime for a company, developing automation and control systems for renewable energy grids. I was programming a simulation for heating grids, including thermal buffer storages and heat exchangers. During that time I took additional courses in maths on measure theory, numerics and functional analysis. 
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            In 2020 I started a masters program at the <a class="text-link" href="#https://www.uni-graz.at/de/"> University of Graz </a> with focus on quantum field theory and gravity. My first gravity course was rather disappointing and I turned more towards quantum theory. I had several positions as a teaching assistent, my favorite however was organising lecture material for Professor Stefan Kurz, from the  <a class="text-link" href="https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/">Technical University     Darmstadt</a>. He was giving a course on differential forms in Electromagnetism in the 2021 summer term. In the summer break of 2021, equipped with two books, an online lecture on Youtube and my newly sparked interesting in geometry, I then decided to take on General Relativity again on my own. Since then I am fascinated with the subject! For my master thesis however I took a very different topic. While studying relativity I came in touch with cosmology and dark matter. Most of my study time I focused on the theoretical aspects of physics and on maths. Hence I figured I could try to something more phenomenological. Even more I wanted to learn more about strongly interacting gauge-theories. I ended up learning a lot about spontanous symmetry breaking, anomalies, homology, representation theory and effective field theories. 
            In winter 2022 I took a little break to travel to Australia, where I was invited to present some of the results of my masters thesis at <a class="text-link" href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/1107937/">DSU 2022</a>. I returned in new year and currently I am writing up my thesis, while looking for a PhD psoition somewhere at the intersection between Quantum Field Theory and Gravity.

            One of the most prominent problems of modern physics is the mystery of Dark matter. Despite ample observational evidence from astrophysics, there is yet no commonly accepted explanation on the level of particle physics. Several models already have been proposed among which so called WIMP dark matter has been investigated most intensively. In the early 2000 <a class="text-link" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9909386"> Spergel and Steinhardt </a> proposed that sufficiently strong self interactions among dark matter particles might resolve some structure formation puzzles like the so called Cusp vs. Core problem. Recent works by have restricted the <a class="text-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06611"> bounds </a> on dark-matter selfinteractions further and favor <a class="text-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08088"> models </a> producing <a class="text-link" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03339"> velocity dependent </a> selfscrattering crosssection.

                In my Masters thesis I investigate a class of models for composite dark matter based on a strongly interacting gauge model. In these szenarios dark matter is made up of bound states (dark pions) of some fermions (dark quarks). Due to the underlying new strong interaction sufficiently large self interaction between the dark matter particles are introduced. Futhermore the stability of the dark matter can be explained by an accidental flavor symmetry.

                My model focuses on fermions that are charged under a real representation, leaving the specific choice of gauge group and representation an open parameter of the theory. As it turns out the reality condition is strong enough to qualitativly restrict all the low energy properties of the theory, while the qualitative features manifest in the low energy effective constants, dependent on the choice of gauge group and representation. The behavor differs from the complex representation of QCD and SU(N) theories and resembles more a SO(N)-like type of theory.        
                The relevant particles my model describes are fermion-fermion bound states, called dark mesons. The lightest stable states are the pseudo-scalar PNGBs, called dark pions, of a spomtanous symmetry breaking szenario. Further the lightest vector meson states (rho, omega) and a pseudo-scalar flavor-singlet meson (eta) related to the chiral anomaly are included.

                If one restricts to a model with 2 fermions one encounters a topological obstruction that leads to the breakdown of <a class="text-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0550321383900639">Witten's geometrical construction</a> of the socalled "Anomalous" or "topological" terms in the effective field theory. We had to go back to the original approach of <a class="text-link" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9602093">Wess and Zumino</a>, which directly related the UV-properties with the IR-properties by investigation of anomalous Ward identities in order to construct these terms. These terms incorporate a 3->2 interaction of the pions which contributes (and even may domintate) the freez out Szenario of dark matter. This socalled <a class="text-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5143">SIMP</a> mechanism was proposed and investigated by the group around <a class="text-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07917">Yonit Hochberg</a>.

                The model may be viewed as standard modell extension and can be coupled to the SM via a Portal mediator. We investigate the case of a massive dark-photon meditor, kinetically mixing with standard model hypercharge. After the introduction of the mediator dark matter annihilation into the standard model compete with the 3->2 process in the freezout. However another decay channel opens with anomalous vertex of the dark eta particle. At the last step of the project we investigate the freeze out szenario in view of these 3 channels.

                We present a class of composite dark matter models with matter fields in a real representation under the non-abelian gauge group. As an exemplary theory we present a Sp(4) gauge theory, with fermions transforming in the antisymmetric representation. We analyze the structure of these theories in the UV and discuss the building blocks of the low energy effective theory in the IR, describing the dynamics of the cold dark matter. We put special focus on the construction of topological terms responsible for 3→2 cannibalization processes within the dark sector and on the physics of the pseudo scalar singlet related to the axial anomaly. We show that both these aspects significantly affect the freeze out calculation of the dark matter relic abundance and thus are relevant for investigations of the parameter space of such theories.

                This theses intends to provide a most elegant derivation of the exact analytic formula of the spontanous magnetization of the 2d Ising-Model, dependent on temperature. A result which was first stated by Lars Onsager. In order to do so the combinatorical problem, encountered when trying to calculate the partition function of the system, is mapped onto an easier algebraic problem. This is done with the help of so-called Graßmann-Numbers. Mathmathical theorem, such as the Szegö's theorem, are used in order to perform the thermodynamiacal limit. This work restricts to isotropic, homogenous two dimensional Ising lattices with periodic boundary conditions. The ideas of this derivation go back to works of Stuart Samuel, Elliot W.Montroll, Renfrey B. Potts und John C. Ward and are not a new result.

                In this project we consider a real scalar quantum field coupled in an expanding spatially-flat FLRW universe. The case of minimal and conformal coupling to the background metric are considered and for the FLRW scaling factor we picked the non-physical choice of a Sauter pulse. Due to the lack of an appropriate notion of time-translation symmetry, energy conservation is violated and one typically expects particle creation. The problem is analytically solvable in terms of hypergeometric functions and thus allows a nice discussion of the rate and amount of produced particles in terms of their mass, the expansion rate and the total expansion.

                In this project we treat a thought-experiment of an astronaut near the event Horizon of a static Black Hole, who drops a Probe into the Black Hole and measures the light signal transmitted by the Probe. We review the properties of the Schwarzschild spacetime in different charts, explain the disadvantages and ambiguities of the Schwarzschild chart and introduce non-pathological coordinates such as lightcone coordinates and Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates. The redshifts, null-geodesics, horizion as well as the introduction of a proper time-orientation on the spacetime are discussed. The apparent paradox, that the probe drops into the black hole after finite time without the astronaut ever observing, it is neatly explained and visualized by the use of these new coordinates in a Penrose diagram.

                In this project we derive the fermionic version of the Wetterich equation for the functional renormalization group flow and apply it to the Gross-Neveu model with N fermion flavors.  A simplistic ansatz for the quantum effective action allows for an analytic solution of the system. The flow equation and the running of couplings are calculated and discussed.
